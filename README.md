# GRIND
GRIND crypto currency

***Under construction ***

GRIND is going to be just an other poopcoin, that will probably never deliver on its empty "promise".
if there is not enough funds to keep developing the ecosystem than its up to you to give the token some value.

there might be better projects out there to invest in, total loss of funds is likely because poopcoins can go to 0.

So, if you invest ,then you only buy the digital token, some magical internet thing you can send around, burn, but can't look at or touch.

you don't buy any rights or product, you just donating so i can keep funding the project in high hopes of it ever mooning or providing value.

The GRIND ecosystem can only work when its running on its own chain, otherwise the transaction fees will just kill the usecase of the platform/network.

people can buy good games for the price of 1 transaction on eth... so think twice before you "faucet" or "BurnToStake".

having an own chain is the goal, but not every realistic. 

support me, buy GRIND
